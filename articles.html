            <p> UX writing is a specialized form of writing because of its context (software) and the environment in which it’s produced (technology companies).</p>
            <p> Because it exists in the context of software, UX writing has unique constraints. It often has to be extremely concise and yet communicate a lot of meaning at the same time. It has a lot in common with poetry: it’s concentrated language. It has to help both users and businesses achieve their goals. It works together with interaction design and visual design to create an experience that’s greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
            <p> UX writing (and design) needs to be accessible to users with different abilities, so that everyone can have a great experience, whether they navigate software with their eyes or ears, whether they see certain colors or not. UX writing needs to be inclusive, so as not to alienate any potential audiences. Often it needs to be easily translatable, so it can be localized across linguistic, geographical, and cultural boundaries</p><br><br>
            <p>These two screens show the same interaction from Lyft Line and uberPOOL. In both, you’ve chosen a shared ride, and the service needs to know how many spots you need.</p>
            <p>Lyft Line and uberPOOL. In both, you’ve chosen a shared ride, and the service needs to know how many spots you need. Lyft begins with an imperative statement, telling you what you need to do— “Confirm number of passengers”—and explains why there’s a limit. Uber begins with a question: “How many seats do you need?”</p>
            <p>Both services give you two options to reply with. Lyft lets you say “Just me” or “Me + 1 friend,” and shows the cost difference right there. Uber gives you numbers to reply with: 1 or 2.</p>
            <p>This is a pretty simple interaction, and both approaches are quite clear. But each service sets a very different tone here. Lyft guides you, informs you, then offers you two very casual, friendly replies. By using “Just me” and “Me + 1 friend,” they’ve planted two hints with you: 1) Lyft is for riding with friends, and 2) you can engage with the Lyft service in a casual, friendly way.</p>
            <p>Uber, in contrast, is extremely minimal. They’ve removed any potential clutter, any information that might not be absolutely essential. And instead of asking about “passengers” or “friends,” they ask about “seats.” This approach is a lot more transactional. As a reader you may prefer one or the other, but personal preference isn’t what really matters when you’re the writer on the other side.</p>
